# BetterStat'er

This repository is the code base of the BetterStat'er script for Unibot. It offers some more flexibility for those that require specific rules for statting in Flyff Universe. The script enables you to set rules for stats (STR, STA, DEX and INT) to be skilled automatically as long as you have remaining stat points available.

## Usage (for players)

The bundled script can be found in the `/dist` folder.
